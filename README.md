We decided not to have seperate ALU and CU abstractions, all of the functionality is added within the core.
How and where to store instructions is still not entirely resolved. Should consult sir.
Added base classes for core and processor.

We decided to use C++ to simulate the RISC-V processor. Had a convo on how and where to store the instructions. Thought of encoding'em in binary.
